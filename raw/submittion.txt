ips for Submitting Your Project
1) Review the Project Submission Guide for detailed instructions and best practices for submitting your project.
2) Save your project often! Use the "Save Progress" button to save your changes as you edit your Project. Your changes will now be viewable to anyone who visits your page. Saving your project does not submit it for judging, you must click “Submit for Judging” to be considered for awards.
3) If you have multiple team members who might be trying to edit your project at the same time, you can toggle the edit "Lock" to 'ON'. This will let other team members know you are making changes to the project tab so they do not try to make edits at the same time. However, another team member may still remove the lock and make changes to the project, overwriting any changes you had not yet saved.
4) Once you are ready, click the "Submit for Judging" button. You should see a notification bar at the top letting you know that your project has been submitted and that your certificate is available.
5) You can see the latest times your project was saved or submitted in the “Edit Details” box on the Project tab. Only your final click on “Submit for Judging” will be reviewed by judges.
