### all files source
Done — I created a single-file static web app (index.html) with:

A Cupola image search (uses the public NASA Image & Video Library API; no API key needed for basic searches).

A Neutral Buoyancy Lab (NBL) mini-game: adjustable ballast slider, canvas visualization, target-depth task and success feedback.

Inline instructions and credits so you can upload the file directly to Google Drive, GitHub Pages, Netlify, or any static host.
